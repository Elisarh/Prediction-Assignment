# Prediction-Assignment

 Background

  Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand and Fitbit, it is now possible to collect largeg amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much a particulary activity they do but they donÂ´t quantify how well they do it. For this project, our goal is to use the data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm and dumbell of 6 participants. They wer asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. The data for this project ii is available here:

   for testing data: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv
 
 Submission
  
 The goal of the project is predict the manner in which they did the exercise. For this purpouse, we use the "classe" variable of the training set. We have to create a report describing how you built the model, how you use cross validation, what you think the expected out of sample error is, and why you made the choices you did. We will also use your prediction model to predict 20 different test cases. We will submit and R markdown and a compiled HTML file describing the analysis.
